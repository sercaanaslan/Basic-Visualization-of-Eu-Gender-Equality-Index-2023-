I visualized the EU GENDER EQUALITY INDEX OF 2023 values with 2 different graphs with a few lines of simple Python code.
I think these simple but effective visualizations will help us understand the European Union's stance on gender equality.
There are many options for more detailed visualizations and analysis. All data have been taken from the European Institute for Gender Equality.
